// In the "dual Pod" technique, clients/users create a server-requesting Pod
// that describes one desired inference server Pod but when it runs is actually
// just a stub. A dual-pods controller manages
// server-providing Pods that actually run the inference servers.

// The server-requesting Pod
// can be queried to discover the set of accelerators (e.g., GPUs)
// that it is associated with.
// Once the server-requesting Pod's container named "inference-server"
// is running, the controller will rapidly poll that container until this query
// successfully returns a result.

// ServerPatchAnnotationName is the name of the annotation on the
// server-requesting Pod that defines how to transform it into the
// corresponding server-providing Pod. The value of the annotation is a
// [Golang template](https://pkg.go.dev/text/template) that expands to a patch
// in Kubernetes YAML (which subsumes JSON). In particular, it is a
// strategic merge patch, as described in
// https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/manage-kubernetes-objects/update-api-object-kubectl-patch/#use-strategic-merge-patch-to-update-a-deployment-using-the-retainkeys-strategy .
// The server-requesting Pod's spec and label and annotation metadata are transformed
// --- by the following procedure ---
// into the spec and label and annotation metadata given to the kube-apiserver
// to define the server-providing Pod.
// 1. Remove all annotations;
// 2. Apply the patch

// is using the server patch to define its server-providing Pod.
